# vehicle-rental-managament-system
In this project I created a simple console application which enables you to rent vehicles (cars, motorbikes) to other people.
Application makes it possible for you to add new vehicles to the base, or delete them. 
Thanks to "Serializable" interface, everytime you close the app, it saves all the vehicles, as well as people who rented them, to files. Every launch reads these files - so you won't lose nothing.
You can also get all vehicles in base in CSV file.
