# vehicle-rental-managament-system
In this project I created a simply console application which enables you to rent vehicles (cars, motorbikes) to other people.
Application makes it possible for you to add new vehicles to the base, or delete they. 
Due to Serializable interface, every exit saves vehicles and people who rented vehicle to files. Every launching reads these files - so you won't lose nothing.
You can also get all vehicles in base in CSV file.
